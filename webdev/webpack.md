## [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) [[Github](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)]

> A bundler for javascript and friends. Packs many modules into a few bundled assets. Code Splitting allows to load parts for the application on demand. Through "loaders," modules can be CommonJs, AMD, ES6 modules, CSS, Images, JSON, Coffeescript, LESS, ... and your custom stuff.

- This is a module bundler which combines all your UI code in whatever extension to HTML, CSS, JS and assets.
